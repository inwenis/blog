## My blog about programming & other stuff

If you find a typo or would like to improve my posts feel free to submit a pull request to [https://github.com/inwenis/blog](https://github.com/inwenis/blog).

Check out my other projects [on my github](https://github.com/inwenis) like [https://github.com/inwenis/collider](https://github.com/inwenis/collider) where I tried to simulate Brownian motions.

My collection of various kata's I've done: [https://github.com/inwenis/kata](https://github.com/inwenis/kata)

I used to teach programming, out of sentiment I kept these two repos:
- [https://github.com/inwenis/sda.javawwa13.prog1.day5.complexity](https://github.com/inwenis/sda.javawwa13.prog1.day5.complexity)
- [https://github.com/inwenis/sda.javawwa13.prog1.day3.array_vs_hashtable](https://github.com/inwenis/sda.javawwa13.prog1.day3.array_vs_hashtable)

Enjoy!
