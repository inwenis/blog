- [https://ohmyposh.dev/](https://ohmyposh.dev/) - amazing prompts - replace that old `$` sign with amazing stuff
  - [https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git) - offers a prompt for git repos. Comes bundled with `oh-my-posh` for PowerShell. Use `oh-my-posh` prompt and `posh-git` for autocompletion.
