# My recommendations
## git
- [https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore) - .gitignore files for your project
- [https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/) - remove password from git history & more

## node
- [https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) - node version manager - install several versions of node and switch between them
- [https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) - same as ^ but for windows

## http
- [https://www.telerik.com/fiddler/fiddler-classic](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler/fiddler-classic) - inspect http traffic/modify & replay requests
