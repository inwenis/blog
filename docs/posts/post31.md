# Google/Google Photos

Google products seem to slowly become worse, examples:

- gmail doesn't recognize flight itinerary
- google photos removed the map view
- google photos - you can't simply remove all your pictures
- google photos - you can't simply download all your pictures
- google photos - using takeout to download pictures leaves you to deal with metadata in json
- google search is loaded with ads
- google search results seem worst than they used to be
- android removed the possibility to record phone calls
- youtube - ads everywhere

I just moved away from Google Photos. For geeks I recommend [https://immich.app/](https://immich.app/). They're amazing.

I used this [https://github.com/TheLastGimbus/GooglePhotosTakeoutHelper](https://github.com/TheLastGimbus/GooglePhotosTakeoutHelper) to fix google takeout.

I would consider paying immich if they offered a hosted version.
