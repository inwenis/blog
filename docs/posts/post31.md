# Google/Google Photos

Google products seem to slowly become worse, examples:

- Gmail no longer recognizes flight itineraries.
- Google Photos:
    - Removed the map view.
    - Doesn’t let you easily delete all photos.
    - Doesn’t offer a simple way to download everything.
    - Takeout exports require dealing with messy JSON metadata.
- Google Search:
    - Cluttered with ads.
    - Results feel worse than they used to be.
- Android removed native phone call recording.
- YouTube is overloaded with ads.

I just moved away from Google Photos. For geeks I recommend . They're amazing.

Just moved away from Google Photos. For geeks, [https://immich.app/](https://immich.app/) is a great alternative — they're amazing.

To fix the chaos from Google Takeout, I used this [https://github.com/TheLastGimbus/GooglePhotosTakeoutHelper](https://github.com/TheLastGimbus/GooglePhotosTakeoutHelper).

Would definitely consider paying for Immich if they offered a hosted version.
