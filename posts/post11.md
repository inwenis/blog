post 11 idea

don't rewrite, improve

is linux so good sice it was improved insted of being rewritten?
is it good since no product manger was pushing for dumb features?

is it better if software developers polish software over time and make it perfect insted of creating sth new to sell?

another idea

do it wrong, don't check how to do it perfectly, just enjhouy doing it, like a kid, don't look up thousands of videos of how people do it perfacly

how many times do you need to do soemthing meaning less before something is meaning ful? it doesn't matter, just do it and enojy it. if something will be uesful - great if not - dosen't matter.
