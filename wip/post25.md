# hey you looser with no money!

In today’s world, accessibility is often a privilege reserved for those with means. While many services and features are technically available to everyone, the reality is that the hurdles involved in accessing them disproportionately impact those with fewer resources. Wealthy individuals and large organizations often find ways to bypass these obstacles, leaving the average person at a significant disadvantage.

Take legal services, for example. Consulting with a lawyer can be prohibitively expensive for many people. However, for those with deep pockets, this cost is a minor inconvenience. Large corporations can easily hire legal experts, giving them an unfair advantage in navigating complex legal issues. Meanwhile, the average person is left to struggle with daunting fees and limited resources.

This disparity is evident in other areas too. For instance, many countries allow phone call recordings for personal protection, yet tech giants like Google have restricted this feature on Android devices. This limitation may hinder regular users, but corporations and wealthy individuals can still access it through specialized services. The barriers set up for the public don’t apply to those who can afford to navigate around them.

A personal experience highlights this point: my company once offered a helpline that connected me with a lawyer. Consulting lawyers directly seemed too costly, but this service allowed me to draft a response to a wrongful claim by a real estate company, saving me a significant amount of money. It was a stark reminder that while some resources are out of reach for many, they can be life-changing when made accessible.

Ultimately, making things inaccessible creates an unfair advantage for those with means. Accessibility should be a right, not a privilege, ensuring everyone has the same opportunities to succeed.
