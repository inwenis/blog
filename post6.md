On ???

Today I have removed something that I allowed to be created feeling that it is redundant from the beginning.

A year ago a student found a tool to auto-generate documentation for our internal SDK from code annotations. They proposed to embed publishing of the documentation to our Continuous Integration pipeline. An idea sound on paper, however considering our team I felt it won't be used. The team was quite enthusiastic about the idea (as our team often is) and enthusiastic when the auto-generated html documentation was presented.

I knew that everyone in our team has the git repo with the SDK on their machine and we rely on intellisense and the code it self for documentation. I thought that we will not change our habbits as the new documentation isin't easier to use than our current apprach and doesn't provide anything extra.

Despite my thoughts I (being the team-lead) allowed this "feature" to be added. I did it because I have already torpedoed a few initiatives of that particular student. I didn't want to kill his motivation. I wanted to let him fiddle what he finds interesting. And there was a slight chance I'm wrong and the docs will catch on.

Today a year later I notice that the docs website no longer works. It was probably down for sometime and no one noticed because no one uses it. I have removed the step from our CI pipeline.

I've been thinking - was I wrong allowing something to be added/created that never payed of.

In this case the investment was small. The gain was that the author got to fiddle with something that we found interesting.
