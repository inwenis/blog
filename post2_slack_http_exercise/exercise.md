An exercise in shell/scripting/regex

It came to your attention that some remote emplyess shared code over https://pastebin.com/.
Your task:
1. find all pastebin links so they can be removed
2. find all other links to see if another server was used to share code


TODO for filip:
- since this is a sample slack export it actually doesn't have any pastebin links - TODO - create some dummy messages in the export with pastebin links
- check how many links are in there so people know when they're done
- create some silly pastebins so people know they've found the right ones
